# Workflow Specification: [WORKFLOW NAME]

> Feature Branch: `[###-workflow-name]`
> Created: [DATE]
> Status: Draft

## Problem Statement

<!-- What user pain point does this workflow solve? Why is the current experience broken or unintuitive? -->

[Describe the problem from the USER's perspective, not from an implementation/agent perspective]

## Business Value

- [Value 1: e.g., "Researchers can understand unfamiliar papers in under 5 minutes"]
- [Value 2: e.g., "Decision-makers can assess whether to invest in a research area"]
- [Value 3]

## User Workflow

<!-- Define the step-by-step flow the user goes through. Each step describes WHAT the user does and sees, not which agent handles it internally. -->

### Step 1: [Action Name]

**User does:** [What the user provides or clicks]
**System responds:** [What the user sees back]
**Input:** [Expected input type/format]
**Output:** [Expected output type/format]

### Step 2: [Action Name]

**User does:** [What the user provides or clicks]
**System responds:** [What the user sees back]
**Input:** [Expected input type/format]
**Output:** [Expected output type/format]

<!-- Add more steps as needed -->

## User Stories

### US-1: [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority:** [Explain the value]

**Acceptance Scenarios:**
1. Given [initial state], When [action], Then [expected outcome]
2. Given [initial state], When [action], Then [expected outcome]

### US-2: [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority:** [Explain the value]

**Acceptance Scenarios:**
1. Given [initial state], When [action], Then [expected outcome]

### US-3: [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority:** [Explain the value]

**Acceptance Scenarios:**
1. Given [initial state], When [action], Then [expected outcome]

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- FR-001: System MUST [specific capability]
- FR-002: System MUST [specific capability]
- FR-003: Users MUST be able to [key interaction]

### Input/Output Contracts

| Step | Input | Output |
|------|-------|--------|
| Step 1 | [type/format] | [type/format] |
| Step 2 | [type/format] | [type/format] |

## Edge Cases

- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Success Criteria

- SC-001: [Measurable metric, e.g., "User gets plain-language summary within 10 seconds"]
- SC-002: [Measurable metric]
- SC-003: [Measurable metric]

## Acceptance Criteria

1. [Criterion 1: e.g., "User never needs to know which agent is running"]
2. [Criterion 2: e.g., "Output includes both simplified text and deeper analysis"]
3. [Criterion 3]
